Project name: The Impact of Employers Attention to Mental Health of their Employees 

In this analysis I will compare self-employment vs hired work type effect on the mental health of the respondents.

The hypothesis I make:

1. Respondents working in the office should have a better mental heath compared to those working remotelly because of socializion and employer care.
2. Employers attention to physical health transforms into better mental health of the employees.
Other goals:

1. Practice SQL quering.
2. Cleaning up the data.
3. Practicing data joins and visualizations.

You are free to suggest any changed on how the project could be improved.
